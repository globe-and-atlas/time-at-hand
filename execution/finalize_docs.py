Handoff-from: none
Handoff-type: new-project
Goal: build a native watchface prototype with article evidence.
Status: Prototype milestone verified; physical trial pending.

Project: /Users/danielbally/Git/time-at-hand
Preview: http://127.0.0.1:4286 (execution/preview.py)
Build: watchface/build/watchface.pbw (Emery, normal local clock)
Evidence: .tmp/verification.json, .tmp/emulator-verification.json, .tmp/live-verification.json
Article: article/draft.md, article/field-notes.md
Independent verifier: approved renderer, browser behavior, final PBW and evidence boundaries.
Next: user enables Dev Connect and installs on paired Pebble Time 2. Capture readability and battery observations before completing article.
Closing audit: the prototype answers the requested behavior. Physical usefulness remains unproven; the article explicitly preserves that gap.
