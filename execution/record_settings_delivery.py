Agent: OpenAI Codex
Handoff-from: OpenAI Codex
Handoff-type: continuation
Goal: two watchface editions with date, fonts and hand settings; update preview and explain store publishing.
Status: implemented and independently verified. Physical trial and publication remain user next steps.

Project: /Users/danielbally/Git/time-at-hand
Preview: http://127.0.0.1:4286 (execution/preview.py)
Builds: dist/origin.pbw; dist/vector.pbw
Source manifest/default build: Original; normal live clock. Distinct embedded UUIDs verified.
Settings: 12 original numeral glyph sets, eight hand colors, widths1–8, independent label sizes, optional tick marks, and optional weekday/day/month/year top/bottom; each edition saves separately. Clay1.1.0 phone configuration bundled. No external data service.
Evidence: .tmp/editions-verification.json, calendar-verification.json, styles-verification.json, calendar-emulator-verification.json. 17 native comparisons pass, including style/date persistence and production live clock. 17,280 styled time states and 5,920 date formatting checks pass. Original digest preserved.
Independent review: verify_two_hands, verify_calendar and verify_styles approved; final native/bundle evidence reviewed by verify_styles.
Emulator gotcha: stop active app before changing UUID; restarting transport between edition fixture batches avoids observed timeouts. See execution/check_calendar_emulator.py and knowledge/ERRORS.md.
Publishing: PUBLISH.md; assets/store/{original,two-hands}/ has three verified native screenshots each. Current official dashboard checked. Nothing uploaded or published; no account accessed.
Next: install on paired Pebble Time 2, operate phone settings, assess wrist readability/battery, then publish chosen edition(s) through dashboard using explicit PBWs.
Closing audit: requested controls are concrete in both preview and native builds. Additional settings are user-authorized; physical usefulness and article conclusions remain unproven. Do not substitute feature count for the wear test.

- Keep distinct UUIDs for Original and Two Hands so each can coexist and retain settings independently.
- Twelve original 5×7 numeral glyph sets preserve layout bounds; date uses a consistent small typeface. No external font assets.
- Hand styling retains optical defaults, supports eight Pebble-native foreground colors and explicit widths1–8. Hour/minute tip labels have independent size choices, and twelve-position ticks are optional. Time labels stay black.
- Bundle Clay1.1.0 configuration rather than hosting a settings page. Browser preferences demonstrate the feature but do not mutate PBWs.
- Use developer dashboard uploads of explicit PBWs for first store release; CLI publish rebuilds the default source edition.
